# Custom CRUD Provider

This provider allows you to manage resources through custom scripts for Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations. It's particularly useful when you need to integrate Terraform with existing scripts or custom automation workflows.

## Example Usage

```terraform
provider "customcrud" {
  # Configuration if needed
}

resource "customcrud_resource" "example" {
  create_script = ["./scripts/create.sh"]
  read_script   = ["./scripts/read.sh"]
  update_script = ["./scripts/update.sh"]
  delete_script = ["./scripts/delete.sh"]

  input = {
    key = "value"
    # Additional input parameters to pass to your scripts
  }
}
```
