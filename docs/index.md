# customcrud Provider

A provider that allows custom CRUD operations via subprocess calls.

## Example Usage

```terraform
terraform {
  required_providers {
    customcrud = {
      source = "registry.terraform.io/customcrud/customcrud"
    }
  }
}

provider "customcrud" {
  # Optionally limit how many executions run in parallel.
  # This is useful if your scripts or tools are not safe to run concurrently.
  # This option defaults to 0 (unlimited parallelism).
  parallelism = 1
}
```

## Schema

### Optional

- `high_precision_numbers` (Boolean) Enable high precision for floating point numbers. This will cause the json parsing for outputs to use 512-bit floats instead of the default 64-bit.
- `parallelism` (Number) Maximum number of scripts to execute in parallel. 0 means unlimited (default).
